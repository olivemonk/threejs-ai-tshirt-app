# 3D T-Shirt Customizer

Welcome to the 3D T-Shirt Customizer repository! This project aims to provide a user-friendly web application that allows users to customize their own 3D t-shirts. With the help of various technologies like React, Three.js, and OpenAI's DALL-E, users can upload custom logos, generate patterns, and even use AI prompts to create unique designs for their t-shirts.

## Features

- **3D T-Shirt Visualization:** The application utilizes Three.js to render a 3D model of a t-shirt, allowing users to see how their customizations will look in real-time.

- **Logo Customization:** Users can upload their own logos or select from a library of pre-defined logos to be placed on the t-shirt. The application provides tools for resizing, rotating, and positioning the logo on the t-shirt.

- **Pattern Generation:** Users can choose from a variety of pattern templates or generate unique patterns using AI prompts powered by OpenAI's DALL-E. This feature allows for endless possibilities and creative exploration.

- **Color Customization:** Users can select different colors for various elements of the t-shirt, such as the fabric, logo, and pattern. A color picker interface makes it easy to choose the desired colors.

- **Realistic Lighting and Shading:** The 3D t-shirt model is rendered with realistic lighting and shading effects to provide a more immersive and visually appealing experience.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and libraries are used in this project:

- **React:** The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a modular and efficient approach to developing web applications.

- **Three.js:** Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library that enables rendering 3D graphics in the browser. It is used to create and manipulate the 3D t-shirt model, apply textures, and handle user interactions.

- **OpenAI:** The DALL-E model from OpenAI is utilized to generate unique patterns based on AI prompts. This integration adds a touch of creativity and novelty to the t-shirt customization process.

## Getting Started
